### Welcome

My name is Felix Vogel. <br/>
I have a severe penguin addiction to the point that I am now making a game which revolves around a penguin. <br/>
I am currently in the possession of 22 penguin-plushies, but the count is likely to increase.

###### A little background to myself

I gained my passion for programming around the age of 13. That's where I was given a powerful enough laptop to play Minecraft on!
It is crazy to see how far technology has come since then. My interest in programming only grew since then and now I am a full-time employed
Software Engineer, it's like a kid dream that came true for me.

###### What do I do outside of programming?

I own 4 Lovebirds and take care of 2 aquariums. It's pretty fun, and my birds are pretty cute, I cannot own a penguin unfortunately.
Other than that I'm your typical at home gamer. Not a lot of action for me.
